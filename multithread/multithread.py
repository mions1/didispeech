		It takes as input the targetted function and kwargs.
		Kwargs will setted as instance variables with "exec" function,

		Furthermore, a general signal is given to know when the thread has been finished

		Utilization example:
			customqthread = CustomQThread(self,

							a=5, b=7)
			customqthread.start()
			customqthread.qthread_finish_signal.connect(<other>)
